    <h2>Giving Credit</h2>
    <p>Often times we have to give credit and here we can get a blockquote: </p>
    <h3>Block Quotes</h3>
    <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Winnie-the-Pooh">
      Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start again?
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Citing</h3>
    <p><cite>Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone</cite> written by J.K. Rowling should base
      sited and we use the cite tag to do it!</p>


    <p>We can add "" by using the q tag like this: <q>Online quotes are not always true</q> <br /></p>
    <h2>Abreviating</h2>
    <p>I can add and an abreaviation for an acronym like this:
      <abbr title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</abbr>.
